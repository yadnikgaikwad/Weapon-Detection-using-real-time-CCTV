# Weapon-Detection-using-real-time-CCTV

The Weapon Detection in Real-Time CCTV project aims to enhance security measures by utilizing advanced deep learning techniques to detect weapons in live video feeds from CCTV cameras. By integrating cutting-edge technologies such as OpenCV for image processing, Firebase for real-time data storage and retrieval, and React.js for a dynamic user interface, this project provides an efficient and responsive solution for real-time surveillance and threat detection.

## Key Features
- Real-Time Detection: The system processes live video streams, identifying potential weapons in real-time to facilitate immediate response and intervention.
- Deep Learning Model: A robust deep learning model is trained on extensive datasets to recognize various types of weapons, ensuring high accuracy and reliability.
- OpenCV Integration: Utilizes OpenCV for video processing, including frame extraction and image manipulation, to detect and highlight weapon instances effectively.
- Firebase Backend: Employs Firebase for real-time data storage, enabling seamless access to detected events, user management, and historical data analysis.
- Interactive Dashboard: Built with React.js, the user interface offers a responsive and user-friendly experience, allowing users to monitor live feeds, view alerts, and access historical data.
- Alert System: Sends instant notifications and alerts to security personnel when a weapon is detected, enhancing response times and situational awareness.

## Technologies Used
1. Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the weapon detection model.
2. Image Processing: OpenCV for real-time video processing and manipulation.
3. Backend Services: Firebase for cloud storage, authentication, and real-time database management.
4. Frontend Framework: React.js for creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.
